## Description
This is a representation learning method for predicting protein-protein interactions (PPI). Our paper about this method is currently under review.
The auto-encoder part of our model is improved based on the implementation by T. N. Kifp. You can find the source code here [Graph Auto-Encoders](https://github.com/tkipf/gae)
